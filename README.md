# Mars Rover Dashboard - Project #2 for Udacity's Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree

## Description
This project lets a user choose from NASA's 3 most recent Mars rovers and display photos taken from the surface. The API used is:

* [NASA Mars Rover Photos API](https://api.nasa.gov/)

Local server running on *Node* and *Express* is used.

## Prerequisite
This project runs on a local server. It uses *Node*. If you don't have *Node* already installed on your machine, you can download it [**here**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You must have an API key for the NASA API above. It is free to receive a key.

After you get your API key, make a file called *.env* in the project root folder. File should contain:

```
API_KEY = {your key here}
```
There is an included file called *.env-sample*. You may add your key to this template file, then change its name to *.env*

## Installation
If *Node* is installed, then you can use the *Node Package Manager (npm)* to install the packages needed to run this program. In the terminal, use this command:

```
npm install
```
When those packages have installed, use the following command to start the *Express* server.

```
npm start
```

## Using the App

The server is set to **port 3000**. Start the server with the command in the previous section.

To load the page, set your browser's address bar to:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

The app returns photos from the rover  and some other information:

* rover name
* launch date from Earth
* landing date on Mars
* mission status (active or complete)
* date of the photos

If you want to go back to the main UI and choose a different rover, you can click a **Back** button, which are located above and below the photo group.
